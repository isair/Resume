                            <p>Ever since I was little I've been a curious person. As a kid I loved playing with legos and k'nex, programming (made some really simple games), painting, reading children's science books, telling stories, taking part in plays, playing chess, and making up my own games. I'm still not very different now.</p>

                            <p>As an adult, I have come to realize that what makes my profession so fun is also what makes life fun: Frequent challenges that make you learn, adapt and grow. Professionally, I experiment with any new language, framework, library, or concept and alike that I can get my hands on.</p>

                                <p>During my final year in high school I started working on my own <strong>simple operating system</strong> using <strong>C</strong> and <strong>x86 ASM</strong> for learning purposes. After several years of inactivity I have recently drafted a plan for development, moved the project to GitLab, and started working on it again. The project aims to create a <strong>WebASM</strong> based operating system.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>While studying at <strong>Koç University</strong> I worked on some projects for the university itself. I have designed and developed <strong>KURadyo</strong>, the official radio application of my school's radio club, for Android and iOS using <strong>Titanium Mobile</strong>. I have also made the website of numerous other school clubs using mainly <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> for server-side development.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Between 2011 and 2012 I have developed and maintained two Mac apps for the <strong>Mac App Store</strong>. The first one, <strong>Code Minifier</strong>, automatically detected and minified html, css, and js files. The highest ranking it got was being the <strong>#3 top paid</strong> developer app in Turkey. My second Mac app was <strong>iMemoryCleaner</strong>, the first inactive memory cleaning app to hit the Mac App Store. It managed to enter the <strong>top 10</strong> paid apps list <strong>in several countries</strong>. After not having the time to release any kind of updates for these apps (as I worked on more important projects and on finishing my school) for a considerable amount of time, I decided not to renew my Mac developer license.</p>

                                <p>In years 2012 and 2013 I have joined the <strong>game jams</strong> named <strong>TGJ</strong> and <strong>GGJ</strong> respectively. Acted as both the <strong>game designer</strong> and a <strong>programmer</strong> in the former; was the sole programmer in the latter.</p>
